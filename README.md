## Programatically access API

To access API programatically a new token need to be created to call API. API's are protected with OpenID Connect and requires jwt Bearer token.

To create a token with curl run following command:

```bash
curl https://login.microsoftonline.com/avinorapi.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/token?p=b2c_1_resource_owner_default -X POST -d 'grant_type=password&client_id=900f6802-0f1b-4e2f-9614-8ebf97e98429&username=<username>&password=******&scope=openid 900f6802-0f1b-4e2f-9614-8ebf97e98429 offline_access' -H 'Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -i
```

The result will contain an `access_token` that can be used for authentication agains API's.

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' https://avinorapi.azure-api.net/...
```
